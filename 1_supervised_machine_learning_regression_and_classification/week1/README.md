Welcome to the Machine Learning Specialization! You're joining millions of others who have taken either this or the original course, which led to the founding of Coursera, and has helped millions of other learners, like you, take a look at the exciting world of machine learning!

**Learning Objectives**
- Define machine learning
- Define supervised learning
- Define unsupervised learning
- Write and run Python code in Jupyter Notebooks
- Define a regression model
- Implement and visualize a cost function
- Implement gradient descent
- Optimize a regression model using gradient descent

## Overview of Machine Learning
### Welcome to machine learning

### Applications of machine learning

## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Machine Learning
### What is machine learning
Arthur Samuel (1959) defined machine learning as a the field of study that gives computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

The two main types of machine learning are **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**.

Of these two, supervised learning is the type of machine learning that is used most in many real-world applications and has seen the most rapid advancements and innovation. In this specialization, which has three courses in total, the first and second courses will focus on supervised learning, and the third will focus on unsupervised learning, recommender systems, and reinforcement learning. By far, the most used types of learning algorithms today are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and recommender systems. 

In this class, one of the relatively unique things you learn is you learn a lot about the best practices for how to actually develop a practical, valuable machine learning system.

### Supervised learning part 1
-  99 percent of the economic value created by machine learning today is through one type of machine learning, which is called supervised learning
